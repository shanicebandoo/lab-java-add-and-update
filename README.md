4. Write README.md
Answer the following questions in the README.md file:

    1. Yes, I did use the 'PUT' method for both departments.
    2. I chose the 'PUT' method because it allows for the complete replacement of a resource thus making APIs 
        clear and consistent. 
    3. The advantages of using the 'PUT' method for updates is that it is 
       consistent, and it is simple in terms of its implementation. 
       As it relates to its disadvantages, the "PUT" method requires sending the entire resource
       which can be inefficient for partial updates.   
        
    4. The 'PUT' method is simpler to implement and better for complete updates, but it can be inefficient for partial updates.
       The 'PATCH' method is more efficient for partial updating but more tedious to implement.
